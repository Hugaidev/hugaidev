# :material-account-check-outline: Human Checkpoints

Human checkpoints are critical validation points where human expertise, judgment, and oversight ensure that AI-generated outputs align with requirements, standards, and organizational policies. These checkpoints maintain the "Human-Governed" aspect of the HUG AI methodology.

!!! warning "Human Oversight Required"
    Stages requiring human review and sign-off to ensure alignment with requirements, policies, and business objectives. These checkpoints cannot be automated and require domain expertise and judgment.

## Checkpoint Philosophy

Human checkpoints serve multiple purposes in the HUG AI methodology:

- **Quality Assurance**: Validate that AI outputs meet functional and non-functional requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify potential issues that automated systems might miss
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure adherence to regulatory and organizational standards
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Facilitate learning and knowledge sharing across team members
- **Accountability**: Establish clear ownership and responsibility for decisions

## Development Lifecycle Checkpoints
