# Governance & Ethics

Governance and ethics form the backbone of the **HUG AI** methodology, ensuring AI-driven workflows remain transparent, accountable, and aligned with human values and legal requirements.

!!! note "Key Objectives"
    - **Accountability**: Define clear decision ownership between AI agents and human stakeholders.
    - **Transparency**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails for prompts, actions, and approvals.
    - **Fairness & Bias Mitigation**: Detect and minimize unintended biases in AI outputs.
    - **Privacy & Security**: Enforce data protection, access controls, and secure handling of sensitive information.
    - **Regulatory Compliance**: Align AI processes with relevant standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).

This section introduces the governance structures, ethical guidelines, and practical controls that embed responsible AI practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## Bias in AI Models

!!! warning "Model Bias Risks"
    AI models can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.

=== "Types of Bias"
    - **Data Bias**: Imbalanced or non-representative datasets skew model outputs.
    - **Algorithmic Bias**: Model architectures or objectives introduce systematic errors.
    - **Evaluation Bias**: Testing on narrow or homogeneous benchmarks masks real-world performance gaps.

=== "Mitigation Strategies"
    - **Diverse Data Sourcing**: Curate datasets that reflect target populations and use cases.
    - **Fairness Metrics**: Measure parity across demographic groups and algorithmic fairness criteria.
    - **Human-in-the-Loop Audits**: Involve domain experts to review edge cases and flagged outcomes.
    - **Regular Re-evaluation**: Periodically retrain and validate models against updated benchmarks.

## Governance of AI Use

!!! note "Governance Framework"
    - **Policy Definition**: Establish clear guidelines on approved AI use-cases and prohibited actions.
    - **Roles & Responsibilities**: Assign governance roles (e.g., ethics board, compliance officer, AI steward).
    - **Decision Checkpoints**: Gate AI outputs through human reviews at critical stages.
    - **Regulatory Compliance**: Map processes to relevant standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, ISO/IEC 42001).

## Traceability & Validation

!!! info "Audit Trails & Logging"
    - Record all AI interactions, including inputs, outputs, model versions, and parameters.
    - Maintain immutable logs or use version-controlled model registries for accountability.

??? details "Example: AI Audit Log Entry"
    ```json
    {
        "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:34:56Z",
        "user": "jane.doe",
        "model": "customer-churn-v2",
        "input": {"customer_id": 12345, "usage_history": [...]},
        "output": {"churn_risk": 0.82},
        "model_version": "v2.1.0",
        "decision_reviewed": true
    }

!!! tip "Validation & Approval"
    Integrate automated validation checks (e.g., invariants, fairness thresholds) and require final sign-off for production deployments.
