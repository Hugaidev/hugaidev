# :material-shield-check-outline: Automated Gates

Automated gates are essential quality controls that automatically validate AI-generated outputs against predefined criteria. These gates ensure consistency, security, and quality without requiring human intervention, enabling fast feedback loops while maintaining high standards.

!!! info "Automated Validation"
    Automated validations that block advancement when quality, security, or performance criteria are not met. These gates provide immediate feedback and enable rapid iteration while maintaining consistent standards.

## Gate Philosophy

Automated gates serve as the first line of defense in the HUG AI methodology:

- **Immediate Feedback**: Provide instant validation of AI outputs
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Apply uniform standards across all code and artifacts
- **Risk Prevention**: Block problematic changes before they reach human reviewers
- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual review overhead by catching common issues automatically
- **Continuous Validation**: Enable frequent, reliable quality checks
