        """Execute a gate based on its configuration"""
        
        # Initialize gate execution
        execution = self.initialize_execution(gate_config, context)
        
        # Execute based on gate type
        if gate_config.type == "automated":
            result = self.execute_automated_gate(gate_config, context)
        elif gate_config.type == "human":
            result = self.execute_human_checkpoint(gate_config, context)
        elif gate_config.type == "hybrid":
            result = self.execute_hybrid_gate(gate_config, context)
            
        # Process results and trigger actions
        return self.process_gate_result(result, gate_config)
        
    def handle_gate_failure(self, gate_config, failure_reason):
        """Handle gate failure scenarios"""
        
        # Determine failure response
        if gate_config.blocking:
            self.block_progression(gate_config, failure_reason)
        else:
            self.log_warning_and_continue(gate_config, failure_reason)
            
        # Trigger notifications
        self.send_notifications(gate_config, failure_reason)
        
        # Escalate if necessary
        if self.should_escalate(gate_config, failure_reason):

## Best Practices and Guidelines

### Gate Design Principles

1. **Fail Fast**: Detect issues as early as possible in the lifecycle
2. **Clear Criteria**: Unambiguous pass/fail criteria for all gates
3. **Proportional Response**: Gate rigor proportional to risk and impact
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and optimization of gates
5. **Human-Centric**: Human oversight for strategic and complex decisions

### Implementation Guidelines

```yaml
implementation_best_practices:
  gate_configuration:
    - "start_with_minimal_viable_gates"
    - "add_complexity_gradually"
    - "validate_gate_effectiveness_regularly"
    - "maintain_clear_documentation"
    
  human_checkpoint_optimization:
    - "provide_clear_context_and_information"
    - "minimize_time_to_decision"
    - "enable_parallel_reviews_where_possible"
    - "implement_effective_escalation_paths"
    
  automation_strategy:
    - "automate_repetitive_validations_first"
    - "maintain_human_override_capabilities"
    - "implement_comprehensive_logging"
    - "provide_clear_failure_diagnostics"
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Gating**: Too many gates slowing down development
2. **Under-Gating**: Insufficient quality control leading to issues
3. **Inconsistent Criteria**: Variable standards across similar gates
4. **Poor Communication**: Unclear expectations for gate participants
5. **Lack of Flexibility**: Rigid gates that don't adapt to context
