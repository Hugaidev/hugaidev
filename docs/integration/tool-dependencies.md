# Tool Dependencies and Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the dependencies and integration patterns between HUGAI tools, providing guidance for system architects and implementers on how tools interact, share data, and coordinate operations within the development ecosystem.

## Tool Dependency Hierarchy

### Foundation Layer (Tier 1)

Base infrastructure tools that provide core capabilities for all other tools.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Version Control] --> B[Code Search & RAG]
    A --> C[Context Store]
    A --> D[Automated Validation]
    
    B --> E[Static Analysis]
    C --> F[Workflow Orchestrator]
    D --> G[CI/CD Pipelines]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#e8f5e8
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Core Dependencies:**
- **Version Control**: Foundation for all code-related operations
- **Context Store**: Central state management and artifact storage
- **Code Search & RAG**: Semantic search and knowledge retrieval
- **Automated Validation**: Quality gates and compliance checking

### Platform Layer (Tier 2)

Integration and orchestration tools that coordinate between foundation tools and specialized services.

```mermaid

    A[Workflow Orchestrator] --> B[CI/CD Pipelines]
    A --> C[Test Automation]
    A --> D[Security Scanning]
    
    E[Context Store] --> A
    F[Automated Validation] --> B
    
    style A fill:#f1f8e9
    style E fill:#fff3e0
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Integration Capabilities:**
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Central coordination of all tool interactions
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deployment and integration workflows
- **Test Automation**: Comprehensive testing across all layers
- **Security Scanning**: Security validation throughout the pipeline

### Specialized Layer (Tier 3)

Domain-specific tools that provide specialized capabilities for particular aspects of development.

```mermaid

    A[Performance Monitoring] --> B[Observability Stack]
    C[Feature Flags] --> D[Deployment Tools]
    E[Static Analysis] --> F[Security Scanning]
    
    G[CI/CD Pipelines] --> A
    G --> C
    G --> E
    
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style A fill:#ffebee
    style C fill:#f9fbe7
    style E fill:#e1f5fe
```

```

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Integration

Tools communicate through events and message queues for loose coupling.

```yaml
event_patterns:
  version_control_events:
    - event: "code_committed"
      triggers: ["CI/CD Pipeline", "Code Search Index Update"]
      payload: ["commit_hash", "changed_files", "author", "timestamp"]
    
    - event: "branch_created"
      triggers: ["Workflow Orchestrator", "Feature Flag System"]
      payload: ["branch_name", "base_branch", "author"]
    
    - event: "pull_request_opened"
      triggers: ["Automated Validation", "Security Scanning"]
      payload: ["pr_id", "changes", "target_branch"]
  
  build_events:
    - event: "build_completed"
      triggers: ["Test Automation", "Deployment Tools"]
      payload: ["build_id", "artifacts", "status", "metadata"]
    
    - event: "tests_passed"
      triggers: ["Security Scanning", "Deployment Pipeline"]
      payload: ["test_results", "coverage", "performance_metrics"]
```

### 2. API-Based Integration

Synchronous communication for real-time data access and coordination.

```yaml
api_integrations:
  context_store_api:
    endpoints:
      - path: "/artifacts/{type}/{id}"
        method: "GET"
        consumers: ["All tools"]
        purpose: "Retrieve artifacts and metadata"
      
      - path: "/workflows/{id}/state"
        method: "GET/PUT"
        consumers: ["Workflow Orchestrator", "CI/CD"]
        purpose: "Workflow state management"
    
  validation_api:
    endpoints:
      - path: "/validate/{artifact_type}"
        method: "POST"
        consumers: ["All tools"]
        purpose: "Quality gate validation"
      
      - path: "/policies/check"
        method: "POST"
        consumers: ["Security Scanning", "Compliance"]
        purpose: "Policy compliance checking"
```

### 3. Data Pipeline Integration

      - "Performance Monitoring"
      - "Test Automation"
      - "CI/CD Pipelines"
    destinations:
      - "Observability Stack"
      - "Analytics Platform"
    frequency: "real-time streaming"

## Troubleshooting and Maintenance

### Common Integration Issues

#### 1. Authentication and Authorization

**Problem**: Tools unable to authenticate with each other
**Solutions**:
- Verify API keys and certificates
- Check service account permissions
- Validate token expiration and renewal
- Review network security policies

#### 2. Data Synchronization Issues

**Problem**: Inconsistent data across tools
**Solutions**:
- Implement eventual consistency patterns
- Add data validation checkpoints
- Use transaction-like operations where possible
- Monitor data drift and implement reconciliation

#### 3. Performance Bottlenecks

**Problem**: Slow tool interactions affecting workflows
**Solutions**:
- Implement caching layers
- Optimize API calls and batch operations
- Use asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Monitor and tune database performance

### Maintenance Procedures

```yaml
maintenance_tasks:
  daily:
    - "health_check_verification"
    - "log_analysis_and_cleanup"
    - "performance_metrics_review"
    
  weekly:
    - "dependency_update_checks"
    - "security_vulnerability_scans"
    - "backup_verification"
    - "capacity_planning_review"
    
  monthly:
    - "tool_version_updates"
    - "configuration_audit"
    - "disaster_recovery_testing"
    - "integration_performance_tuning"
```

## Migration and Upgrade Strategies

### Tool Replacement Strategy

```yaml
migration_approach:
  phases:
    1. "parallel_deployment"
       - Deploy new tool alongside existing
       - Implement dual-write patterns
       - Validate functionality parity
       
    2. "gradual_cutover"
       - Route percentage of traffic to new tool
       - Monitor performance and functionality
       - Rollback capability maintained
       
    3. "full_migration"
       - Complete traffic cutover
       - Decommission old tool
       - Update all dependent configurations
    
  rollback_procedures:
    - Automated rollback triggers
    - Data synchronization verification
    - Dependency chain updates
    - Stakeholder notification protocols
```

### Version Compatibility Matrix

| Tool | Version | Compatible With | Breaking Changes |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Version Control | 2.40+ | All current tools | API authentication changes |
| Context Store | 3.2+ | Workflow Orchestrator 2.1+ | Schema migration required |
| CI/CD Pipelines | 1.8+ | All tools except Legacy Static Analysis | New webhook format |
| Security Scanning | 4.1+ | Static Analysis 2.0+ | New report format |
