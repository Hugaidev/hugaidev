# Agents Overview

HUGAI employs a network of specialized AI agents that collaboratively manage every phase of the AI development lifecycle—from refining raw stakeholder inputs to designing system architectures, generating code, and orchestrating deployments. Each agent embodies a focused expertise, ensuring modular workflows, scalability, and clear accountability, with human reviews at critical handoffs. The newly introduced Domain Expert Agent enriches and validates artifacts with deep subject-matter insights, bridging the gap between automated processes and real-world domain requirements.

## Section Structure

This Agents section provides reference documentation for each specialized AI agent in the HUGAI methodology. Every agent page follows a consistent format to help you quickly find the information you need:

- **Frontmatter**: Metadata for navigation (title, description).
- **Overview**: High-level summary callout explaining the agent’s purpose.
- **Core**: Detailed breakdown of Capabilities, Responsibilities, and Metrics.
- **Inputs, Outputs & Checkpoints**: Lists of inputs, outputs, and human or automated review gates.
- **Specs**: Configuration examples (`agent.name`, input sources, processing steps), agent prompt templates, and sample outputs.
- **Integration**, **Workflow Behavior**, **Best Practices**, **Limitations**: Guidance on how the agent fits into pipelines, operational notes, recommended patterns, and caveats.

This standardized layout ensures consistent presentation, making it easy to browse, configure, and integrate agents within your projects.

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [Prompt Refiner Agent](prompt-refiner-agent.md) | Refines stakeholder inputs into precise prompts, ensuring clarity and appropriate context. |
| [Requirements Analyzer Agent](requirements-analyzer-agent.md) | Extracts user stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases from requirements. |
| [Router Agent](router-agent.md) | Orchestrates task routing, directing artifacts to the appropriate agents and managing workflow state. |
| [Architecture Agent](architecture-agent.md) | Suggests architecture patterns, generates system diagrams, and documents design rationales. |
| [Implementation Agent](implementation-agent.md) | Generates code scaffolds, applies refactorings, and enforces coding standards. |
| [Documentation Writer Agent](documentation-writer-agent.md) | Produces inline code comments, README files, and external API documentation. |
| [Domain Expert Agent](domain-expert-agent.md) | Validates and enriches artifacts with subject-matter expertise, ensuring domain accuracy and terminology consistency. |
| [Branch/PR Manager Agent](branch-pr-manager-agent.md) | Manages Git branches, creates pull requests, and handles merges. |
| [Integration Agent](integration-agent.md) | Manages API contracts, data transformations, and system integrations. |
| [Test Agent](test-agent.md) | Generates unit, integration, performance, and bias tests; maintains test suites. |
| [Internal Reviewer Agent](internal-reviewer-agent.md) | Reviews code quality, enforces standards, and provides improvement suggestions. |
| [Security Agent](security-agent.md) | Performs vulnerability scans, threat modeling, and compliance checks. |
| [Performance Agent](performance-agent.md) | Monitors performance metrics, detects bottlenecks, and recommends optimizations. |
| [Deployment Agent](deployment-agent.md) | Generates infrastructure-as-code, configures CI/CD pipelines, and orchestrates rollouts. |
| [DevOps Agent](devops-agent.md) | Automates environment provisioning, deployment orchestration, and operational tasks. |
| [Maintenance Agent](maintenance-agent.md) | Performs technical debt analysis, dependency updates, and system health monitoring. |
| [Retry Agent](retry-agent.md) | Detects task failures, analyzes errors, and re-executes tasks with improved context. |
| [Compliance Agent](compliance-agent.md) | Automates policy and legal compliance checks, generates reports, and enforces governance rules. |
| [Risk Management Agent](risk-management-agent.md) | Identifies, assesses, and mitigates project risks throughout the lifecycle. |
| [Observability Agent](observability-agent.md) | Implements end-to-end observability, metrics collection, and alerting. |
| [Knowledge-Base Manager Agent](knowledge-base-manager-agent.md) | Ingests, indexes, and curates project documentation and data into a semantic knowledge base. |
| [Escalation Manager Agent](escalation-manager-agent.md) | Manages intelligent escalation processes, issue routing, and stakeholder communication for critical situations. |
