title: Codex Agent
description: Generates, explains, and modifies source code in response to natural language tasks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Codex Agent

> Translates natural language instructions into executable code, offering real-time completions, explanations, and refactorings while adhering to organizational coding standards and governance policies.

---

## Core

### Capabilities

* Generate code from structured prompts and contextual examples.
* Refactor existing code to improve readability, performance, or maintainability.
* Explain unfamiliar code snippets to human developers.
* Detect and address simple bugs based on natural language descriptions.
* Support multiple programming languages and frameworks.

### Responsibilities

* Produce syntactically and semantically valid code.
* Maintain coding standards defined by the organization.
* Log all prompt inputs and code outputs for auditability.
* Collaborate with the Prompt Refiner and Implementation Agent for optimized generation.

### Metrics

* Code Generation Accuracy
* Lint Compliance Rate
* Build Success Rate
* Review Pass Rate
* Prompt Clarity Score

## Inputs, Outputs & Checkpoints

### Inputs

* Refined prompts from Prompt Refiner Agent
* Contextual files from version control
* Code style guides and architectural constraints

### Outputs

* Generated code (functions, classes, modules)
* Inline comments or code explanations
* Refactoring logs
* Pull request diffs (via PR Manager Agent)

### Checkpoints

* **Code Review Approval** (Human)
* **Linting & Style Gate** (Automated)
* **Security Gate** (Automated)
* **Documentation Gate** (Automated)

## Specs

### Configuration Example

```yaml
agent.name: codex_agent
input_source: refined_prompts/
output_path: generated_code/
language: python
tools: [pylint, black, bandit]
```

### Prompt Template

```text
"Generate a Python function that parses a CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries.
The CSV contains a header row. Use built-in libraries only. Add docstrings."
```

### Sample Output

```python
import csv

def parse_csv_to_dicts(file_path):
    """
    Parses a CSV file into a list of dictionaries.

    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: List of rows as dictionaries.
    """
    with open(file_path, mode='r', newline='') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        return list(reader)
```

## Integration

* Triggered by Prompt Refiner Agent or Implementation Agent.
* Communicates with PR Manager Agent for branch updates.
* Participates in test scaffolding via Test Agent integration.

---

## Workflow Behavior

* On receiving a prompt, parses language intent and contextual inputs.
* Retrieves relevant codebase context via RAG or search APIs.
* Generates or modifies code and annotates changes.
* Passes outputs through validation gates before human review.

---

## Best Practices

* Use prompt templates and context windows to guide precise outputs.
* Validate outputs through unit tests and linters.
* Pair code generation with human review to maintain trust.
* Encourage small, modular prompts for better results.

---

## Limitations

* May produce syntactically correct but semantically flawed code.
* Cannot understand implicit business rules unless provided explicitly.
* Requires curated context for accuracy and relevance.
* Susceptible to overconfidence without external verification.
