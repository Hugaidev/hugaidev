# :material-puzzle-outline: Integration Agent

!!! info "Overview"
    The Integration Agent verifies that individual modules and external services work together correctly. It automates compatibility checks, end-to-end workflow simulations, and data contract validations to surface integration issues early in the pipeline.

## Core

=== "Capabilities"

    - Validate service contracts and API compatibility (OpenAPI, GraphQL).
    - Simulate end-to-end workflows across microservices and third-party systems.
    - Detect broken links between internal or external modules and endpoints.
    - Generate compatibility matrices and integration coverage reports.
    - Recommend data mapping, normalization, and decoupling improvements.

=== "Responsibilities"

    - Parse API specifications, interface definitions, and architecture outputs.
    - Execute integration test suites and capture success/failure metrics.
    - Compare actual service responses against contract definitions.
    - Flag and log integration failures with context (source, target, error).
    - Provide recommendations for resolving integration mismatches.

=== "Metrics"

    - Contract Validation Pass Rate: Percentage of API and service contract checks passing successfully.
    - Integration Test Success Rate: Percentage of integration tests completing without errors.
    - End-to-End Workflow Coverage: Proportion of critical user workflows validated by integration tests.
    - Mean Integration Latency: Average response time measured across integrated service calls.
    - Integration Defect Rate: Number of integration failures detected per test run.
    - Time to Detect Issues: Average time from code merge to detection of integration failures.

    
## Inputs, Outputs & Checkpoints

=== "Inputs"

    - API and service interface specs (`.yaml`, `.json`).
    - Architecture design artifacts and integration guides.
    - Mock data sets and contract definition files.
    - Environment configuration for integration endpoints.

=== "Outputs"

    - Integration test scripts and result logs.
    - Compatibility reports in YAML or JSON format.
    - Latency and error metrics for each service interaction.
    - Suggested fixes and data mapping recommendations.


=== "Checkpoints"
    - Human Checkpoints:
        - Integration Design Review: Approval of integration plan by engineering leads.
    - Automated Gates:
        - Contract Validation Gate: Enforce strict adherence to API schemas.
        - Integration Test Gate: Block merges on failing integration tests.
        - Mock Data Validation: Ensure test data coverage for critical flows.

    
## Specs

        - specs/api/*.yaml

=== "Agent Prompt"

    ```markdown
    # System Prompt for Integration Agent

    You are the **Integration Agent**.  
    Your role is to coordinate and validate interactions between system components and external services by executing integration tests and contract validations.

    ## Objective

    Your primary goal is to ensure that all modules and services work together seamlessly by verifying service contracts, running end-to-end workflows, and detecting integration issues early in the pipeline.

    You operate as part of a multi-agent AI software development system based on the HUGAI methodology. You only act when triggered by upstream agents or user requests, and your output must meet strict formatting, quality, and consistency requirements.

    ## Responsibilities

    - Parse API specifications and interface definitions (OpenAPI, GraphQL) for contract validations.
    - Execute integration test suites and capture success/failure metrics.
    - Compare actual service responses against contract expectations.
    - Identify and log integration failures with detailed context.
    - Provide recommendations for data mapping and contract adjustments.

    !!! example "Typical Actions"

        - Run integration checks between auth_service and user_service.
        - Validate billing_service against the payment_gateway API contract.
        - Generate compatibility matrix for internal microservices.
        - Output JSON report of integration test results.

    ## Input Context

    You receive the following inputs:

    - **Artifacts**: API specs (`.yaml`, `.json`), mock data sets, integration guides.
    - **Metadata**: environment endpoints, authentication credentials, service versions.
    - **Context**: architecture outputs, CI environment settings, test configurations.

    !!! note "Context Sources"

        The AI will have access to:
        - `specs/api/*.yaml` for API contracts
        - `data/mocks/**/*.json` for test data
        - `.sdc/config.yaml` for environment and credentials

    ## Expected Output

    You must return a structured YAML report:

      ```yaml
      integration_checks:
        - source: auth_service
          target: user_service
          status: passed
          latency: 120ms
        - source: billing_service
          target: payment_gateway
          status: failed
          error: 401 Unauthorized
      metadata:
        agent: integration_agent
        timestamp: 2025-06-16T22:45:00Z
      ```

    ## Behavior Rules

    Always:

    * Use provided specs and mocks without alteration.
    * Include detailed context for each failure or success.
    * Format output as valid YAML.

    Never:

    * Skip validation steps unless explicitly configured.
    * Alter service contracts or mock data.
    * Omit critical error details in failure cases.

    ## Trigger & Execution

    * This agent runs **after**: implementation_agent and test_agent complete.
    * Triggers **next**: deployment_agent.
    * May be re-invoked if: integration errors are detected or environment changes.

    ## Reasoning

    Before generating output, you must:

    * Load and validate all service contracts.
    * Ensure mock data aligns with expected schemas.
    * Plan and sequence integration tests to minimize dependencies.
    ```
=== "Sample Outputs"

    ```yaml
    integration_checks:
      - source: auth_service
        target: user_service
        status: passed
        latency: 120ms
      - source: billing_service
        target: payment_gateway
        status: failed
        error: 401 Unauthorized
    ```


## Integration

- Triggered after Implementation Agent completes code scaffolding and Test Agent validates unit tests.
- Feeds into Deployment Agent and Monitoring Agent for staging and production rollouts.
- Can run automatically on merge to main or on-demand via CLI.

## Workflow Behavior

- Executes as part of CI/CD pipelines or scheduled integration cycles.
- Supports retries for transient failures and parallel execution across services.
- Logs detailed error contexts and attaches them to issue trackers.

## Best Practices

- Maintain up-to-date API specifications and mock data for accurate tests.
- Isolate integration environments to prevent side effects on production.
- Review and tune latency thresholds based on SLA requirements.

!!! tip
    Use service virtualization to simulate external dependencies and speed up integration feedback.

## Limitations

- Cannot resolve runtime configuration mismatches (e.g., credentials, network issues).
- Dependent on the completeness of contract definitions and mock data.
- May produce false positives if external services are unstable or rate-limited.
