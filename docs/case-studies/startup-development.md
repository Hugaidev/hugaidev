export const PatientDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const [patientData, setPatientData] = useState<PatientData | null>(null);
  const { secureGet } = useSecureAPI();

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadPatientData = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await secureGet('/api/patient/dashboard');
        setPatientData(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load patient data:', error);
      }
    };
    
    loadPatientData();
  }, [secureGet]);

  return (
    <div className="patient-dashboard">
      {/* AI-generated HIPAA-compliant UI components */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Backend Architecture
```typescript
// AI-generated Node.js API with healthcare compliance
import express from 'express';
import { authenticateHIPAA } from '../middleware/hipaa-auth';
import { auditLog } from '../middleware/audit';
import { PatientService } from '../services/patient';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/patient/:id', 
  authenticateHIPAA,
  auditLog('patient_data_access'),
  async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const patient = await PatientService.getSecurePatientData(req.params.id);
      res.json(patient);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve patient data' });
    }
  }
);
```
